(* Substitute several expressions.
   Note that in the definition, each time we substitute an
   exp (u), we need to lift it by the number of exps remaining
   in the list (us). This is because we're placing the substitued
   exp under the binders corresponding to the remaining ones.
   The added lifting is then gradually "undone" each time we
   substitue one of the remaining expressions. This happens due
   to the free variable/Gt case in the definition of substX.
   Example:
               (A->B), A |- 0 :: A
               (A->B), A |- 1 :: (A->B)
    (A->B), A, A, (A->B) |- (0 1) [1 0] :: B

    Substitute first exp in list.
            (A->B), A, A |- (2 0) [0] :: B
    We get '2' by adding the length of the remaining substitution
    (1) to the index substituted (1). The argument of the function
    is changed from 1 to 0 by the free variable case of substX.
    Substitute remaining exp in list.
               (A->B), A |- (1 0) :: B
    Here, 0 is subst for 0, and 2 changes to 1 due as it's a free
    variable.

Fixpoint substXXs (d: nat) (us: list exp) (xx: exp) :=
 match us with
 | nil      => xx
 | u :: us' => substXXs d us'
                 (substXX d (liftXX (List.length us') 0 u)
                            xx)
 end.

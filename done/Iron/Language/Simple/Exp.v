(* Weak normal forms.
   Expressions in weak normal form cannot be reduced further by
   call-by-value evaluation.
   Note that c.b.v does not reduce under lambdas, which makes
   the result of an evaluation a *weak* normal form (instead of
   a strong normal form).
   It's not *weak head* normal form because we use strict function
   application, so the function arguments are reduced to wnf before
   substituting. *)

(* Lifting of references into the environment.
   When we push new elements on the environment stack, we need
   to lift referenes to existing elements across the new ones.
   For example given:
             t1, t0 |- 0 1 (\. 0 1 2) :: t3
   Pushing two more elements gives:
     t1, t0, ta, tb |- 2 3 (\. 0 3 4) :: t3

(* Used when evaluating all the expressions in a list.
   If all the exps in a list are either wnf or have some property,
   then they're either all wnf
     or there is a context consisting of a run of wnf expressions
        followed by one with the property.
   For example:
     C = w1 w2 w3 w4 x1 ?? ?? ?? ??
   This is a context consisting of a run of four wnfs, followed
   by an expression x1 with the desired property. The rest may or
   may not be wnfs, but the'll all have the property.

(* Used when evaluating a list of expressions.
   We take an expression from the first list, evaluate it, and
   place the result in the second. For this to happen we need
   to find an appropriate joint evaluation context.
   If we can produce a wnf for every expression in the first list,
   then either all exps are already wnf
     or we can find a joint context consisting of a run of wnf
        expressions, followed by an expression that we can evaluate.

   For example:
    C1 =  w1 w2 w3 x4 ?? ?? ??
    C2 =  w1 w2 w3 w4 ?? ?? ??
   Here we have such a joint context. The first three values in
   each are idential and already wnf. We then have x4 and y4,
   where x4 can be evaluated into y4. The rest may or may not
   be wnfs, but the'll still be related.
